# Swiss-smart-travel

Swiss-smart-travel is a project developed in 36h during the [StartHack](http://starthack.ch/) hackaton in 2018.

The idea behind this project was to solve the issue of multi-destination travel, mostly for people that travel to discover Switzerland.
We created an API that takes as input a text query, a duration (1 day - 2 weeks) and start & end locations. 
As output, the API gives a list of the 10 most interesting cities regarding the text query, and a proposed tour in a subset of those cities.

We also built a front-end demo of the API usage with an interactive user interface, available at [swiss-smart-travel.com](http://swiss-smart-travel.com/).
