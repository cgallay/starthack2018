In the Treaty of Schönbrunn (1809), the Habsburg Monarchy ceded the lordship of Rhäzüns to France. It reverted to Habsburg after the defeat of Napoleon in 1814, but was assigned to Grisons in the Vienna Congress of 1815 (article 78). The transition of administrative power to Grisons, as a canton of the restored Swiss Confederacy, became effective only on 19 January 1819.\n",
